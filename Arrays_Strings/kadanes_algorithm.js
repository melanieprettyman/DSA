/**
 * KADANE'S ALGORITHM
 *
 * Purpose: Used to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within
 * a one-dimensional numeric array.
 *
 * Why It Works: Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm keeps track of the maximum subarray sum ending at the
 * current position by using maxCurrent, and updates maxGlobal if maxCurrent itself becomes
 * larger. This ensures that the maximum subarray sum is captured efficiently in a single pass.
